# GeoMHCII

![cover-large](./assets/main_fig.png)

We propose GeoMHCII, a novel geometric deep learning framework designed for pan-specific MHCII peptide interaction predictions. Our method utilizes structural augmentations generated by co-folding models and evolutionary guidance from pretrained protein language models, enabling robust and generalizable modeling of pMHCII interactions.
